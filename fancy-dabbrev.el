;;; Commentary:
;;
;; fancy-dabbrev essentially wraps the Emacs built-in dabbrev functionality,
;; with two improvements:
;;
;; 1. Preview: If fancy-dabbrev-mode is enabled, a preview of the first
;;    expansion candidate will be shown when any text has been entered. If
;;    fancy-dabbrev-expand then is called, the candidate will be expanded.
;;
;; 2. Popup menu: The first call to fancy-dabbrev-expand will expand the
;;    entered word prefix just like dabbrev-expand. But the second call will
;;    show a popup menu with other candidates (with the second candidate
;;    selected). The third call will advance to the third candidate, etc. It is
;;    also possible to go back to a previous candidate by calling
;;    fancy-dabbrev-backward. Selection from the menu can be canceled with C-g.
;;    Any cursor movement or typing will hide the menu again.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;; ============
;;
;; To load fancy-dabbrev, store fancy-dabbrev.el in your Emacs load path and
;; put something like this in your Emacs configuration file:
;;
;;   ;; Load fancy-dabbrev.el:
;;   (require 'fancy-dabbrev)
;;
;;   ;; Enable fancy-dabbrev previews everywhere:
;;   (global-fancy-dabbrev-mode)
;;
;;   ;; Bind fancy-dabbrev-expand and fancy-dabbrev-backward to your keys of
;;   ;; choice:
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'fancy-dabbrev-expand)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "<backtab>") 'fancy-dabbrev-backward)
;;
;;   ;; If you want TAB to indent the line like it usually does when the cursor
;;   ;; is not next to an expandable word, use 'fancy-dabbrev-expand-or-indent
;;   ;; instead:
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'fancy-dabbrev-expand-or-indent)
;;
;;
;; CONFIGURATION
;; ============
;;
;; fancy-dabbrev-expand uses dabbrev-expand under the hood, so most dabbrev-*
;; configuration options affect fancy-dabbrev-expand as well. For instance, if
;; you want to use fancy-dabbrev-expand when programming, you probably want to
;; use these dabbrev settings:
;;
;;   ;; Let dabbrev searches ignore case and expansions preserve case:
;;   (setq dabbrev-case-distinction nil)
;;   (setq dabbrev-case-fold-search t)
;;   (setq dabbrev-case-replace nil)
;;
;; Here are fancy-dabbrev's own configuration options:
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-menu-height (default: 10)
;;
;;   How many expansion candidates to show in the menu.
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-preview-delay (default: 0.0)
;;
;;   How long (in seconds) to wait until displaying the preview after a
;;   keystroke. Set this to e.g. 0.2 if you think that it's annoying to get a
;;   preview immediately after writing some text.
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-expansion-context (default: after-symbol)
;;
;;   Where to try to perform expansion. If 'after-symbol, only try to expand
;;   after symbols (as determined by `thing-at-point'). If 'after-non-space, try
;;   to expand after any non-space character.
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-preview-context (default: 'at-eol)
;;
;;   When to show the preview. If 'at-eol, only show the preview if no other
;;   text (except whitespace) is to the right of the cursor. If
;;   'before-non-word, show the preview whenever the cursor is not immediately
;;   before (or inside) a word. If 'everywhere, always show the preview after
;;   typing.
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-no-expansion-for (default: '(multiple-cursors-mode))
;;
;;   A list of variables which, if bound and non-nil, will inactivate
;;   fancy-dabbrev expansion. The variables typically represent major or minor
;;   modes. When inactive, fancy-dabbrev-expand will fall back to running
;;   dabbrev-expand.
;;
;; * fancy-dabbrev-no-preview-for (default: '(iedit-mode isearch-mode
;;   multiple-cursors-mode))
;;
;;   A list of variables which, if bound and non-nil, will inactivate
;;   fancy-dabbrev preview. The variables typically represent major or minor
;;   modes.
;;
;; WHY?
;; ====
;;
;; There are many other Emacs packages for doing more or less advanced
;; auto-completion in different ways. After trying out some of the more popular
;; ones and not clicking with them, I kept coming back to dabbrev due to its
;; simplicity. Since I missed the preview feature and a way of selecting
;; expansions candidates from a menu if the first candidate isn't the right
;; one, I wrote fancy-dabbrev.
;;
;; Have fun!
